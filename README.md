### Shop

#### Snacks
Purchasing snacks will increase your `efficiency 🛠`. Your efficiency score determines how many unicorns you receive for every click on the Shopify bag. A player will start off with 1 efficiency and can purchase snacks to increase this number. For example, if you have 1000 unicorns 🦄 and your first snack purchase is a baguette 🥖 your efficiency will increase by 15 🛠. So now every time you click the Shopify bag you will receive 16 unicorns 🦄 (including one unicorn every player starts with).

Here are what the different snacks cost and the increase in efficiency they offer.

| Snack | Emoji | Efficiency 🛠 | Cost 🦄 |
|-------|:-----:|---------------|---------|
| Cookie |🍪| +0.1 | 10 |
| Popcorn |🍿| +1.25 | 100 |
| Avocado |🥑| +2.5 | 200 |
| Pancakes |🥞| +7.5 | 500 |
| Baguette |🥖| +15 | 1000 |
| Taco |🌮| +75 | 5000 |
| Bagel |🥯| +150 | 10000 |
| Milk |🥛| +5000 | 250000 |

#### Equipment
Purchasing equipment gives will increase your `autonomy ⚙️`. Your autonomy score determines how many unicorns you receive every second that the game progresses for. A player will start off with 0 autonomy meaning they will not receive any unicorns automatically. A player can purchase equipment to increase their autonomy. For example, if you have 100 unicorns 🦄 you can purchase a Floppy Disk 💾 which will increase your autonomy by 1 ⚙️. So now every second you are playing the game, you will receive 1 unicorn automatically.

Here are what the different equipment cost and the increase in autonomy they offer.

|-----------|:-----:|------------|---------|
| Floppy Disk |💾| +1 | 100 |
| Compact Disk |💿| +5 | 500 |

### Stock Market
In this game you are able to buy corns 🌽 for a certain number of unicorns 🦄 at any point. The price of one corn fluctuates very rapidly. The purpose of these corns is to buy them at a low price and hope that over time they increase in price so that you can make a profit when they are sold. The Stock Market is a risky investment and often a gamble in this game. The price fluctuates by a random amount between -25 and +25. The functionality of the stock market simulates heavily volatile day trading.
