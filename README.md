# JS Fundamentals Final Project


## Detailed requirements

### General

- Follow the Shopify Style Guide (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. and write the game entirely using JavaScript ES6.

- Make great use of Classes and Object Literals in your code.

- Your code is written in multiple .js files if/when appropriate, through use of modules

- Your code is commented properly and is easy to follow.

- Any CSS/HTML work will be looked at, but will not weigh heavily in your final evaluation. That said, it should still be in good form.

### Game option

- The game must be live and fully playable by the due date.

- The game follows traditional Clicker mechanics (ie: you click things, numbers go up, gameplay expands overtime)

- The game must have an ending and / or goal.
Automatically save the players progress, reloading the page will bring the user where they left off.

- Create cheating functions that allow you to test and demo aspects of the game through the console.

- The game must listen for some type of Input Event from the user and act upon it.

### App option

- Your app's use case should be mostly front-end focused and have a rich, interactive UI. If anything, you can create a simple web server to allow you to run off of `localhost` (which can help with CORS issues).

- Given the above, if there is anything you need to save during a session, just use `localstorage` instead of a back-end database/datafile.

- As a minimum, the app must:
  - Make an Ajax request
  - Have event listeners
  - Manipulate DOM elements in some way
  - Implement form elements in some way
  - Must little to no business logic located in your HTML (perhaps just to initialize your app object)
  - It is preferred that you do not use a framework, but if you really think it would benefit your use case, please bring the proposal up to your instructor. Be aware that you don't have a lot of time for this project, so it might not be a good idea to learn one if you haven't used it before. If you have used it before, make sure that you still meet the above requirements.

- You are strongly discouraged from using jQuery, but if you must, please try to keep its use to a minimum. You *cannot* use Prototype (sorry York...).
